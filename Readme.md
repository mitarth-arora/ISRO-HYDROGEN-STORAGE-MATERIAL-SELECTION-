The main aim behind this project is to design a material made up of Mg-Li Binary alloy

which would be used out for the storage of Hydrogen gas and we would look upon its

various applications in real aspects.

The Targeted Delieverables of this project related to ISRO are as follow:

1. ) Knowing the importance of hydrogen storage at industrial level
1. ) Study of various materials that are currently used for hydrogen storage

applications along with their specific characteristics

1. ) Why Mg-Li alloys as hydrogen storage material?
1. ) Theoretical prediction of different Mg-Li alloys for hydrogenation and

dehydrogenation kinetics

1. ) Problems and Solutions of different Mg-Li alloys for Hydrogenation and

DeHydrogenation Kinetics Principles

1. ) Classification based on crystal structure, Role of vacancies and interstitials to

improve the hydrogen storage.

1. ) Explaining hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process with help of flowchart.
1. ) Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation aspects on the Mg based alloys
1. ) Viewing out the Macrostructures of Mg AZ31
